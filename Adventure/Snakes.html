    <p>The knight fell through the opening of the cage. He did not know what he fell on, but when he looked down he discoverd that he landed on a stack of snakes ! He also noticed that he could not breath very well because a python was constricting him so he pulled it off and threw it. The knight did not know how to get out of the cage, so he dug under the snakes to find something. He found a passage, but finding the secret passage he found a way out. The knight did not know what to do so he was thinking. As he was thinking a snake bit him. It was not a poisonous one </p>
    
    
    
    <p>Where should the knight go to the <a href= "Passage.html">secret passage</a>or to the <a href= "medic.html"> medic ?</a></p>
