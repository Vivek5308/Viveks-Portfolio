    <h1>The Adventure pg.2 Sharks</h1>


<p>The knight fell into the cage but luckily he knew how to swim. The knight did not know that he fell in a shark cage, so he went to explore. But then sudenlly a shark came out of no where and bit the knights armour right off. It was on his arm. The knight was weeping in pain, but then he saw a secret passage. He was in a lot of pain and did not know what to do. Go through the passage or go to a medic ? </p>
    
    <p>Where should he go, to the <a href= "Passage.html"> secret passage</a> or to the <a href= "medic.html">medic ?</a></p>
